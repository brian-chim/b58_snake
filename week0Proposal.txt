Project Details
---------------
Project Title: Snake
 
Project Description: 
A simple take on the classic game of snake (with a few extra features like high score and possibly multiplayer version like the Tron game)

Code URL (please upload a copy of this file to your repository at the end of the project as well, it will
serve as a useful resource for future development): https://github.com/thisisafakename/b58_snake
 
Proposal
--------
What do you plan to have completed by the end of the first lab session?:
Be able to get a proper VGA connection with the given monitor and create moving objects to be displayed on 
said monitor as well as create a counter for the high score.

What do you plan to have completed by the end of the second lab session?:
Have the basic features of Snake implemented (snake collision with walls and itself, growing the snake every 
time it hits a certain object, etc).
 
What do you plan to have completed by the end of the third lab session?:
Debug any remaining issues and get multiplayer done.
 
What is your backup plan if things donâ€™t work out as planned?
Create the game of Simon Says.
 
What hardware will you need beyond the DE2 board?
- Joysticks 
- Monitor
 
Motivations
-----------
How does this project relate to the material covered in CSCB58?:
We will be utilizing a joystick as input to the movement of a snake and utilize flip-flops to create a finite state 
machine to monitor the different states of the snake (size of the snake, snake collision, snake direction).
 
Why is this project interesting/cool (for CSCB58 students, and for non CSCB58 students?):
This project will involve us taking a simple arcade classic and creating our own enhanced version of it using 
the knowledge gained from lectures and previous labs.
 
Why did you personally choose this project?:
We wanted to extend our knowledge of FSMs to recreate the game of snake which utilizes many different 
and constantly changing states.
